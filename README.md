# Classification-of-Noise-Refugee-Zones
For the NOISE Project, I developed a machine learning model to classify noise refuge areas using noise levels, locations, and user-reported mood. Using Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Trees, and a Regularized Decision Tree, I achieved 89.24% accuracy. This showcases my expertise in classification algorithms and model evaluation.
